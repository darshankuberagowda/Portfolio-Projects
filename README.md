Title: Retail Performance Analytics 


Introduction:
Welcome to my Retail Performance Analytics  project, where I showcase proficiency in SQL, Excel, and Tableau. This project aims to demonstrate my ability to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize data effectively, providing valuable insights to stakeholders.

Objective:
My primary objective in this project is to create a comprehensive sales dashboard for the executive team of a theoretical bicycle retail company. This involves pulling relevant data from the company's database, cleaning and analyzing it, and presenting insights through interactive visualizations.

Methodology:

Data Extraction (SQL): I start by extracting data from the company's relational database using SQL queries. This involves selecting specific fields such as order ID, customer information, sales volume, product details, store information, and sales rep data.

Data Cleaning (SQL): Once I've extracted the data, I proceed to clean it to remove any inconsistencies, redundancies, or missing values that may affect analysis. This ensures that the dataset is accurate and reliable for further processing.

Data Analysis and Visualization (Excel): Moving to Excel, I utilize pivot tables and charts to analyze the cleaned dataset. I calculate total revenues per year and month, analyze revenue breakdowns by state, store, brand, product category, top customers, and sales rep.

Interactive Dashboard Creation (Tableau): The final step involves creating an interactive dashboard using Tableau. I connect the Excel dataset to Tableau and design visualizations such as line charts, map charts, pie charts, and treemaps. These visualizations allow stakeholders to explore the data dynamically, filtering by year and state to gain insights into the company's performance.

Results:
The culmination of my data analytics portfolio project is a visually appealing and interactive dashboard that provides valuable insights to the executive team. Stakeholders can easily navigate through the dashboard, exploring key metrics such as total revenues, revenue breakdowns by various categories, and top-performing sales reps and customers.

Conclusion:
Through this project, I've demonstrated proficiency in data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization using SQL, Excel, and Tableau. The insights gained from this exercise can inform strategic decision-making processes within the theoretical bicycle retail company, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.
